The primary goal of this shapes demo is to communicate between a TSS application and the Shapes Demo. In order to faciliate communication there is a workaround in the TSS application to change the type name from FACE::DM::RTI:ShapeType to ShapeType. This change is needed because in order to match when using DPSE, the type names need to match and Shapes Demo is looking for ShapeType.

These notes are going to outline subscribing from Admin Console 7.3/6.x to a TSS application using DPSE with LBED. This repo includes all the necessary configuration files needed for this demo.

Configurations
 - RTI_Connext_TSS_Examples/3.1.2/shapes_dpse/lbed/RTI_ADMIN_CONSOLE_PROFILE_6.x_LBED.xml: includes profile that enables LBED and inherits from the default Admin Console profile.
 - RTI_Connext_TSS_Examples/3.1.2/shapes_dpse/lbed/LBEDiscoveryPluginExample.xml: indluces LBED definitions used for 6.x
 - RTI_Connext_TSS_Examples/3.1.2/shapes_dpse/lbed/USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml: includes QoS profile for Admin Console 7.x, profiles for 6.x, 7.3 and LBED configuration for 7.3.
 - RTI_Connext_TSS_Examples/3.1.2/shapes_dpse/idl/ShapeType.xml: IDL converted to XML

Steps to execute Demo of Admin Console subscribing to a TSS application.

*Best practice is to configure Admin Console then start your TSS application.*

1. Configure Admin Console.
   a. Admin Console 6.x
      - Load RTI_ADMIN_CONSOLE_PROFILE_6.x_LBED.xml QoS file.
         - In Admin Console navigate to View -> Preferences.
         - In the Preferences Window select Administraiton in the left panel.
         - In the Administration window select 'Add Files(s)' from the Files specifying QoS profiles section and navaigate to the XML file.
      - Once loaded, open the drop down menu in the Domains section and select the profile "AC_LBED_Base_Profile_6.x".

   b. Admin Console 7.3
      - Load USER_QOS_PROFILES.xml QoS file.
         - In Admin Console navigate to View -> Preferences.
         - In the Preferences Window select Administraiton in the left panel.
         - In the Administration window select 'Add Files(s)' from the Files specifying QoS profiles section and navaigate to the XML file.
      - Once loaded, open the drop down menu in the Domains section and select the profile "AC_LBED_Base_Profile_7.3".

2. Start TSS application
3. In Admin Console DDS logical view right click on the topic published by the TSS application and select subscribe.
   - Note, that Square, Circle and Triangle topic will appear in the DDS Logical view. This occurs because all topics are defined in the LBED configuration.
   a. Configure subscription
      - Select 'Load Data Types from XML file'. Select "+" and navigate the to the ShapeType.xml file then press "OK".
      - Select the published type name from the drop down list.
      - Open the advanced settings.
         - Select the QoS profile with the correct type and version (ie LBEDiscoveryPluginExample_Library::LBED_Circle_ShapeTypeX_Subscriber_6.x or 7.3).
      - Press 'OK' to subsribe
4. Navigate to the topic data tab and see samples as they arrive
